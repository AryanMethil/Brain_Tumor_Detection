# Brain_Tumor_Detection
Deep learning model to classify brain MRI images into tumor and non-tumor


### Setting up folders
1. Create a folder in your drive : Brain_Tumor_Classification
2. Create 3 subfolders : input, models, src
    1. input :
        1. brain_tumor_dataset : The dataset folder (needs to be manually uploaded)
        2. new_brain_tumor_dataset : (Just create an empty folder by this name; the files will be uploaded by the code)
        3. Final_brain_tumor_dataset : (Just create an empty folder by this name; the files will be uploaded by the code)
    2. models :
        (Just create an empty folder by this name; the files will be uploaded by the code)
    3. src :
        1. \_\_init\_\_.py : Create an empty file by this name only(don't change the file name)
        2. Brain_Tumor_Detection.ipynb
        3. constants.py : (Download the .py version of constants.ipynb as .py has to be imported in the Brain_Tumor_Detection.ipynb file)
